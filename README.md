# Implementation of HarvardX CS50's problems from 2018

This repository contains my implementations of the CS50 problems of 2018. The implementations are done in C, Python, SQLite, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I can only recommend this course to anyone who wants to start learning how to code. 

If you use my code as a reference, please do not copy it. It is in the interest of academic honesty and general best practices that you cite any sources you used to come up with your **own** solution. More details on the course's poliy on academic honesty can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/). If you want to get more details on the course, check out its [website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/).
